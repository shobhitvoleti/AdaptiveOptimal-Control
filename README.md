# AdaptiveOptimal-Control
Adaptive Optimal control for Linear Systems
Summary of the project is available in the report

'RLC_policy.slx': simulink file for the policy iteration algorithm. Running it should generate the required output

'plot_policy.m': Generates required plots after 'RLC_policy.slx' is run

'infLQR.m': Used to find the solution to the infinite time LQR problem for given system

Folder 'Inverse_Opt' contains trivial piece of code to simulate the example system and to compare between HJI and pointwise min norm solution
